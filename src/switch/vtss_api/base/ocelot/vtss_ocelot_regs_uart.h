 * The output baud rate is equal to the VCore system clock frequency
 * divided by sixteen times the value of the baud rate divisor, as follows:
 * baud rate = (VCore clock freq) / (16 * divisor). Note that with the
 * Divisor set to zero, the baud clock is disabled and no serial
 * communications occur. In addition, once this register is set, wait at
 * least 0.1us before transmitting or receiving data.

/** 
 * \brief
 * Use this register to access the Rx and Tx FIFOs.
 * When reading: The data in this register is valid only if LSR.DR is set.
 * If FIFOs are disabled (IIR_FCR.FIFOE), the data in this register must be
 * read before the next data arrives, otherwise it is overwritten,
 * resulting in an overrun error. When FIFOs are enabled (IIR_FCR.FIFOE),
 * this register accesses the head of the receive FIFO. If the receive FIFO
 * is full and this register is not read before the next data character
 * arrives, then the data already in the FIFO is preserved, but any
 * incoming data is lost and an overrun error occurs.
 * When writing: Data should only be written to this register when the
 * LSR.THRE indicates that there is room in the FIFO. If FIFOs are disabled
 * (IIR_FCR.FIFOE), writes to this register while LSR.THRE is zero, causes
 * the register to be overwritten. When FIFOs are enabled (IIR_FCR.FIFOE)
 * and LSR.THRE is set, 16 characters may be written to this register
 * before the FIFO is full. Any attempt to write data when the FIFO is full
 * results in the write data being lost.
